# Project Upshot
Evaluating NYTimes polling performance.

[Click here for the GitHub repo.](https://github.com/UnlikelyVolcano/project-upshot)

## Description 
During the 2018 midterm elections, I saw the NYTimes' live polling data and thought, "I wonder how they're making those charts." So I looked at the source of their website, found the JSON files with the live information, built a scraper, and re-engineered the plots in ggplot2.

My plan was to compare certified election results to the NYT predictions -- to demonstrate that confidence intervals are frequently misunderstood and misrepresented. I have yet to complete the task, but one of these days I'll pull in official election returns for all the districts mentioned here and create an output table.

In the meantime, [enjoy the charts.](https://github.com/UnlikelyVolcano/project-upshot/tree/master/Charts)

## To-Do
- Import official election returns
- Match districts
- Create tabular & graphcal display -- final result on top of original images.
