# Project Upshot

During the 2018 midterm elections, I saw the NYTimes' live polling data and thought, "I wonder how they're making those charts." So I looked at the source of their website, found the JSON files with the live information, built a scraper, and re-engineered the plots in ggplot2. At the time, my plan was to compare certified election results to the NYT predictions -- to demonstrate that confidence intervals are frequently misunderstood and misrepresented. I didn't get a chance to do that, but I figured this might be interesting anyway. Enjoy!
